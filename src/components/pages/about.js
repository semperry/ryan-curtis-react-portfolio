        Pluto's a planet. I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones
        please. cell phone, no no no rotary... and payphone on half. If anything
        happened to you I would kill myself! I love you bad, bobo! I'll tell you
        how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people
        runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 +
        2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they
        give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take
        a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I
        know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue.
        I just killed my family! I donâ€™t care who they were! That's Right Morty!
        This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. It's gonna make
        sense. Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a
        bunch a cronenbergs walkin around. I don't like it here Morty. I can't
        abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I
        consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your
        butt? Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa! Not MY fault
        this is happening.
